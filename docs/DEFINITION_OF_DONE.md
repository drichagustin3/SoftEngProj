# Hope, Inc. ERP — Definition of Done (DoD)

To uphold rigorous quality standards and safeguard the main branch against regressions, all submitted Pull Requests must satisfy this Definition of Done prior to review approval and merging.
---

## 1. Code Quality & Standards
- [ ] Code strictly follows established formatting and linting conventions.
- [ ] Variable and function names are self-documenting and match ERP domain terms (e.g. custNo, prodCode, 	ransNo).
- [ ] Existing comments and docstrings are preserved.

---

## 2. Database & Data Architecture (Student Guide §2.2, §2.3)
- [ ] **Audit Columns Present:** Every table modified or created MUST contain:
  - status VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Active' ('Active' or 'Inactive').
  - stamp VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL (e.g. 'CREATED system ...', 'EDITED user1 ...', 'DELETED user2 ...').
- [ ] **Soft Delete Enforced:** Records are never physically deleted via DELETE FROM .... Deletion is implemented by updating status = 'Inactive' and recording the actor in stamp.
- [ ] **No Docker Dependency:** All migrations and database scripts run cleanly in local developer environments without containerization.
- [ ] **Referential Integrity:** Foreign key constraints are enforced to prevent orphaned records.

---

## 3. Security & Access Control (Student Guide §1.2, §3.8, §4.2)
- [ ] **Server-Side Enforcement:** Route security and permissions are verified on the backend server (equireRole, equireRight). Hiding buttons on the client is only a UI convenience; API endpoints must reject unauthorized requests with HTTP 403 Forbidden.
- [ ] **Password Security:** All passwords must be salted and hashed using crypt (cost >= 10) or Argon2id. Plain text passwords must never be stored in the database or logged.
- [ ] **Data Privacy Act (RA 10173):** Personal data (birth dates, salaries, job histories) must only be visible to users with explicit viewing rights (jobhistory.view).
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Credentials, database passwords, and session secrets reside strictly in .env.

---

## 4. Testing & Verification
- [ ] All unit, integration, or regression tests pass without errors.
- [ ] Edge cases (e.g. duplicate emails, expired tokens, blocked accounts) are covered with negative tests.

---

## 5. Review & Git Workflow
- [ ] PR branch follows naming standard 
- [ ] PR template is filled out completely with linked issue (Closes #...).
- [ ] Approved by at least one (1) peer reviewer.
